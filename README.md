# **Project-SABER**   
### **Sentinel Adversary Behavior & Event Recognition**  

Project-SABER is an open-source repository of **Microsoft Sentinel KQL queries** designed for **enhanced detection, threat hunting, and event analysis**.  

##  **What’s Inside?**  
- **Analytical Rules** – Proactive threat detection with KQL  
- **Hunting Queries** – Advanced threat investigation techniques
- **Parsers** – Data normalization to enhance log visibility  

## **Why Use SABER?**  
- **Strengthen your security posture** in Microsoft Sentinel  
- **Improve detection engineering** with curated KQL queries
- **Use Parsers for log analysis or detection engineering** 

## **Getting Started**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-SABER.git
   ```  
2. Explore the directories
3. Implement the KQL queries in **Microsoft Sentinel** or  **Defender XDR**

##  **KQL Basics**  
Kusto Query Language (KQL) is used in Microsoft Sentinel for querying logs and creating detection rules. Below is an introduction to KQL syntax, operators, and examples.

### **Basic Syntax & Structure**  
A simple KQL query consists of a **table reference**, followed by **filters**, **transformations**, and **aggregations**.

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| project TimeGenerated, Account, Computer
```

### **Common Operators**  
- `where` – Filters data based on conditions.
- `extend` – Adds new calculated fields.
- `ago` – Returns the time offset relative to the time the query executes
- `project` – Selects specific columns.
- `summarize` – Aggregates data (e.g., counts, sums).
- `join` – Combines data from multiple tables.
- `parse` – Extracts data from unstructured text.
- `contains/has` – Looks for any substring match - Looks for a specific word

### **Example Queries**  
Find failed logon attempts:
```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize count() by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

Find unusual process creation events:
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "powershell"
| summarize count() by InitiatingProcessAccountName
```

##  **Detection Engineering**  
Detection Engineering involves creating **efficient and accurate** detection rules to identify malicious activity in security logs. 

### **Key Concepts**  
- **Behavioral Detection** – Identify patterns of malicious activity.
- **Tuning Detections** – Reduce false positives by refining queries.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration** – Enrich detections with external threat data.
- **Correlation** – Combine multiple data sources to detect complex attack chains.

### **Best Practices for Detection Engineering**  
1. Use **efficient filtering** (`where` instead of `search` where possible).
2. Minimize **performance impact** (avoid unnecessary `join`s).
3. Optimize queries with **summarization** (`summarize` to reduce dataset size).
4. Include **contextual data** to improve analyst understanding.
5. Continuously **test and refine** detections to minimize noise.

##  **Understanding Parsers in KQL**  
Parsers are used in KQL to extract structured data from unstructured logs. This helps in normalizing logs and making them more useful for threat detection.

### **Common Parsing Methods**  
- `extract()` – Uses regex to extract data.
- `parse-kv()` – Parses key-value formatted data.
- `parse` – Extracts fields from structured strings.

### **Example: Extracting Data with `extract()`**  
```kql
let log = "User=admin IP=192.168.1.1 Action=FailedLogin";
print extract("IP=(\\d+\.\\d+\.\\d+\.\\d+)", 1, log)
```
Output:
```
192.168.1.1
```

Using `parse-kv()` to extract fields:
```kql
let log = "User=admin;IP=192.168.1.1;Action=FailedLogin";
print parse-kv(log, ";", "=")
```

Parsers are **essential** for normalizing logs and making them usable in detection rules.
